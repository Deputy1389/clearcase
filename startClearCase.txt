# startClearCase.txt

You are resuming work on the ClearCase project.

Before doing anything else:
1. Load and treat as authoritative: CLEARCASE_HANDOFF.txt
2. Read continue.txt (quick resume snapshot)
3. Read the most recent entry in SESSION_LOG.md
4. Read NEXT_STEPS.md

Rules:
- Do not re-architect or simplify unless explicitly instructed
- Assume Prisma v7 is already stabilized
- Assume Postgres runs via Docker
- Assume Fastify API Phase 2 exists
- Execute in batch mode: do not ask for routine non-destructive confirmations
- If a step is in plan and non-destructive, do it directly
- Only ask before actions that delete data, drop DB, remove migrations, or remove large code sections

Your job in this session:
- Continue from the current phase listed in NEXT_STEPS.md
- Make the smallest correct changes needed
- Show file paths, diffs, and PowerShell commands
- If something is ambiguous and blocks execution, ask one clarifying question

Do not generate explanations unless asked.
Do not invent requirements.
Proceed step by step.
