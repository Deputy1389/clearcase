RE: Claim #2026-0673 – Auto Collision Loss

We have completed our review and are denying coverage for the above claim. The investigation revealed you failed to report the accident within the 48-hour notification period required by Section 12.3 of the policy, and the responding officer’s report notes the vehicle was unregistered at the time of loss. As such, the loss is excluded under Policy Exclusion 4(h).

You may appeal this decision in writing within 20 days, providing any correction to the facts or additional documentation. Enclose the detailed accident timeline, registration renewal receipt, and a mechanic’s inspection report if available.
