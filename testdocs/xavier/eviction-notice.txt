Subject: Notice to Vacate – Lease Termination

Per the terms of your lease and Metro City Ordinance 7.2, you are being delivered this 30-day notice to vacate the premises for repeated lease violations, including unauthorized subletting and failure to maintain the unit. You must surrender the unit by March 14, 2026, and return all keys to the leasing office. Failure to vacate will result in the owner filing for unlawful detainer and seeking rent through the end of the notice period plus court costs.

You may request a hearing in the Metro County Housing Court within seven days of this notice if you dispute the termination. Please document repair requests you submitted, rent receipts, and any communications to support your defense.
