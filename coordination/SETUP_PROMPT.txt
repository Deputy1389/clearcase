Coordination setup (required before implementation):

Create and use `coordination/` as the shared status contract between builder + advisor.

Ensure these files exist and keep them updated:
1) `coordination/CURRENT_TASK.md`
2) `coordination/BUILD_STATUS.md` (append-only, newest on top)
3) `coordination/DECISIONS.md`
4) `coordination/BLOCKERS.md` (only when blocked)
5) `coordination/NEXT_PROMPT.txt` (single source of next action)

Read in order:
1) `CLEARCASE_HANDOFF.txt`
2) `improvements.txt`
3) `advisor.txt`
4) `NEXT_STEPS.md`
5) `coordination/NEXT_PROMPT.txt`

Required status format:
## [UTC timestamp] Status
- Completed:
- In progress:
- Files changed:
- Tests run + result:
- Risks:
- Next step:

Guardrails:
- No legal advice phrasing.
- Keep tone calm, non-directive, non-alarmist.
- Spanish rules from `improvements.txt` are mandatory.
- Localize user-facing copy only; keep facts/enums canonical.
