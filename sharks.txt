CLEARCASE - SHARK TANK INVESTOR BRIEF
Version: Draft 1
Date: 2026-02-11

==================================================
1) ONE-LINE PITCH
==================================================
ClearCase is a legal clarity platform that helps everyday people understand legal documents, track deadlines, and decide when to escalate to a lawyer - before they overpay or miss critical steps.

==================================================
2) THE ASK
==================================================
We are seeking: $[FILL] for [FILL]% equity.
Implied valuation: $[FILL].

Use of funds (12-18 months runway):
- 40% product engineering (uploads, OCR, truth layer, compliant chat)
- 25% go-to-market (content, partnerships, paid acquisition testing)
- 20% legal/compliance and attorney network development
- 10% cloud/AI infrastructure
- 5% ops and contingency

==================================================
3) THE PROBLEM
==================================================
Consumers face three painful realities:
1. Legal processes are confusing, time-sensitive, and intimidating.
2. Lawyer time is expensive, even for basic document interpretation.
3. People often do not know what to do next, what to gather, or whether they even need a lawyer yet.

Current alternatives are poor:
- Generic internet searches are unreliable.
- Traditional legal services are expensive and slow for early triage.
- AI chatbots can hallucinate and often lack auditable grounding.

==================================================
4) THE SOLUTION
==================================================
ClearCase provides:
1. Document-first intake (image/PDF upload).
2. Deterministic OCR extraction.
3. Structured fact/deadline classification.
4. Plain-English explanations with explicit uncertainty.
5. Evidence and action checklist.
6. Escalation path to a human lawyer when needed.

Core product principle:
- Legal clarity, not legal advice.
- LLMs format and explain extracted structured data.
- No raw images sent to LLMs.
- Outputs are auditable ("show receipts").

==================================================
5) WHY NOW
==================================================
- AI tooling has matured enough for practical document pipelines.
- Consumers are more willing to use legal-tech self-service products.
- Economic pressure makes transparent, lower-cost legal support attractive.
- Courts and legal workflows are still document-heavy and process-heavy.

==================================================
6) TARGET CUSTOMER
==================================================
Primary:
- Individuals with civil legal paperwork (landlord/tenant, debt, family, small claims, notices, demand letters).

Secondary:
- Families assisting relatives through legal processes.
- Small business owners handling low-complexity legal paperwork.

Initial persona:
- Cost-conscious, high anxiety, time-sensitive user who needs "what do I do next?" quickly.

==================================================
7) MARKET OPPORTUNITY
==================================================
Top-down TAM framing:
- US legal services and legal-adjacent consumer spend is large and fragmented.
- Even a narrow segment of self-serve civil-document support is sizable.

Bottom-up SOM framing (recommended for investor discussion):
- Start with one or two high-volume use cases.
- Example: [FILL monthly target users] x [FILL conversion] x [FILL ARPU].

Investor-ready numbers to prepare before pitch:
- TAM ($)
- SAM ($)
- 3-year SOM ($ and customer count)
- Key assumptions for each layer

==================================================
8) BUSINESS MODEL
==================================================
Hybrid model:
1. Freemium entry
- Limited cases and basic summary.

2. Subscription tiers
- Core: $12-$19/month
- Plus: $29-$39/month

3. Optional paid human escalation
- Fixed-price attorney consult add-ons
- Clear, transparent pricing and scope

Monetization logic:
- Subscription supports recurring revenue.
- Consult handoff captures high-intent moments.
- Better preparation lowers lawyer time and raises user trust.

==================================================
9) PRICING STRATEGY
==================================================
Proposed launch pricing:
- Free: 1 case, limited uploads, basic explanation
- Core ($15/mo target): multi-case tracking, deadline timeline, richer summaries
- Plus ($35/mo target): priority processing, exports/case packet, advanced support

Add-ons:
- Lawyer consult slots (15/30 minutes)
- Priority turnaround
- Document packet export

==================================================
10) PRODUCT ROADMAP
==================================================
Current status:
- Phase 2 API skeleton completed and verified.

Near-term roadmap:
- Phase 3: S3 upload plumbing + asset metadata
- Phase 4: async worker (SQS)
- Phase 5: OCR adapter
- Phase 6: truth layer (structured extraction and deadlines)
- Phase 7: LLM formatting and explanation layer

Future roadmap:
- Grounded chat on extracted facts
- Lawyer escalation workflow and marketplace-style routing
- Consumer case timeline and reminders

==================================================
11) GO-TO-MARKET
==================================================
Primary channels:
1. SEO/content around specific legal document questions.
2. Short-form educational content (TikTok/Reels/YouTube Shorts).
3. Partnerships with community legal aid and advocacy groups.
4. Referral loops from successful outcomes.

Acquisition wedge:
- Solve one urgent document type exceptionally well first.

Activation strategy:
- "Upload your notice -> get next steps in minutes."

Retention strategy:
- Ongoing deadline tracking and case progress reminders.

==================================================
12) TRACTION (FILL WITH REAL DATA)
==================================================
Replace placeholders with live numbers before any pitch.

Product:
- Waitlist size: [FILL]
- Monthly active users: [FILL]
- Cases created: [FILL]
- Documents processed: [FILL]

Conversion:
- Free -> paid conversion: [FILL]%
- Trial -> paid conversion: [FILL]%
- 30-day retention: [FILL]%

==================================================
13) UNIT ECONOMICS FRAMEWORK
==================================================
Per paid user per month:
- Revenue: $[R]
- Variable costs:
  - OCR: $[A]
  - LLM/API: $[B]
  - Storage/bandwidth: $[C]
  - Payment processing: $[D]
  - Support: $[E]
- Contribution margin = R - (A+B+C+D+E)

Break-even users:
- Fixed monthly burn / contribution margin per paid user

Example:
- ARPU = $18
- Variable cost = $5
- Contribution margin = $13
- If burn = $12,000/mo, break-even = ~923 paid users

==================================================
14) COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
==================================================
Who you compete with:
- Consumer legal subscriptions
- AI legal assistant tools
- DIY form/document tools
- Traditional attorney consults

Differentiation:
1. Document-first, workflow-first, not chat-first.
2. Deterministic extraction before AI explanation.
3. Auditability and transparency.
4. Cost-saving pre-lawyer preparation.
5. Human escalation built into the funnel.

==================================================
15) DEFENSIBILITY / MOAT
==================================================
Near-term moat:
- Proprietary workflow + UX for legal clarity
- Structured legal document dataset accumulation
- Feedback loops on extraction quality and outcome quality

Long-term moat:
- Case outcome-linked accuracy improvements
- Distribution and trust brand in a high-friction category
- Lawyer network + consumer-side workflow integration

==================================================
16) LEGAL / COMPLIANCE POSITIONING
==================================================
Positioning rules:
- "Legal clarity" and "information," not legal advice.
- Clear disclaimers and escalation for legal counsel.
- No fabricated certainty; explicit uncertainty signaling.
- Jurisdiction-aware wording.

Investor talking point:
- Compliance-by-design is a product feature and market advantage.

==================================================
17) RISKS AND MITIGATIONS
==================================================
Risk: Hallucinated or incorrect guidance
Mitigation:
- Deterministic extraction first
- Grounded outputs only from structured facts
- Confidence labels and disclaimers

Risk: High AI/OCR cost
Mitigation:
- Strict prompt/input minimization
- Tier limits and rate controls
- Async architecture and caching

Risk: Regulatory/ethics concerns
Mitigation:
- Clear non-advice framing
- Counsel review on product language and flows
- Audit logs for outputs

Risk: Customer acquisition cost
Mitigation:
- Focused wedge use case first
- Content and partnership-led distribution
- Conversion and retention instrumentation from day one

==================================================

==================================================
20) 90-SECOND SHARK TANK SCRIPT (DRAFT)
==================================================
Hi Sharks, I'm [NAME], founder of ClearCase.

When people receive legal documents, they are confused, stressed, and often overpay for basic clarification.
ClearCase gives them legal clarity before they make expensive mistakes.

Users upload a legal document, we extract facts and deadlines deterministically, and return plain-English next steps with receipts and uncertainty labels.
When needed, we escalate to a human lawyer.

We are not replacing lawyers. We are reducing confusion and unnecessary legal spend while improving preparedness for paid counsel.

Our business model is freemium plus subscription, with optional paid lawyer escalation.
We're raising $[FILL] for [FILL]% to accelerate product, distribution, and compliance-safe growth.

Join us in making legal help more accessible and less intimidating for everyday people.
