You are my “parallel agent team” setup lead for this repo.

Goal:
Set up a reliable workflow where I can run 3–5 Codex CLI agents in parallel without stepping on each other, using git worktrees + branches.

What I need from you:
1) Inspect this repo and tell me the best 3–5 parallel agent roles for THIS project right now (e.g., Feature, Bugfix, Tests, Docs/Refactor, Infra).
2) Create a concrete worktree plan:
   - branch names
   - folder names
   - exact git commands to create each worktree
3) For each agent, write a tight “mission prompt” (what to do, what not to do, definition of done).
4) Tell me exactly how to run each agent in separate terminals (cd path + codex command).
5) Provide a safe merge plan back into main:
   - review steps
   - merge order
   - conflict strategy
6) Include a cleanup plan (removing worktrees + deleting branches).

Constraints:
- Keep diffs small and scoped per agent.
- No changes to production secrets or credentials.
- Prefer tests for any behavior change.
- If the repo has a linter/test runner, use it.
- Don’t guess tool commands for this repo; discover them from package files (package.json, pyproject, Makefile, etc.) and then use those.

Start by:
- identifying the project type and existing scripts/commands
- then propose the agent team structure
- then output the exact commands and prompts in copy/paste blocks.
